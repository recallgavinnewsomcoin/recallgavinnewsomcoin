Dogecoin Core 0.14.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[RGNCoin Core](http://recallgavinnewsomcoin.com/) is the reference RGNCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Bitcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run RGNCoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/rgncoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/dogecoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run rgncoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag RGNCoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run RGNCoin-Core.
